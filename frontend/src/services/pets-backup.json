            "desc": "Nobleman is slower to warm up to new people and would do best in a home willing to work with him and understanding his need to come to people on his own terms. This includes letting him sniff a new person and letting him walk away until he is ready to interact with them.  Nobleman is house and crate trained. We are looking for a home that will continue with the training and socialization methods set in place by his amazing trainer and foster parents. He needs patience, structure.He would do best in a home without small children or cats. While Nobleman does get along with his foster pack he would prefer to be an only dog If you are looking for a giant loving soul who will give you his full devotion in exchange for continuing to help him gain his confidence Please apply below!",

Your new pet will require a refresher in house-training. K-9 Lifesavers strongly recommends all new adopters enroll their new pet into obedience training. This provides for an easier transition into a new home, ensures the dog remains well socialized, and helps form a bond between the dog and the new family.",
